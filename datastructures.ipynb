    "Common operations performed on dictionaries include:\n",
    "- **Adding and Updating** using assignment such as `my_dict['new_key'] = 'new_value'` to add a new key-value pair or update an existing one.\n",
    "- **Removal** using methods like `.pop(key)`, which removes the key and returns its value, and raises a `KeyError` if the key is not found. The `.popitem()` method can be used to remove and return the last inserted key-value pair.\n",
    "- **Lookup** directly via keys like `value = my_dict['key1']` which retrieves the value for 'key1'.\n",
    "- **Iterating** through keys, values, or key-value pairs using `.keys()`, `.values()`, and `.items()` respectively.\n",
    "- **Checking Membership** of keys using `key in my_dict` to check if a key is present in the dictionary.\n",
    "- **Getting Values** with `.get(key, default)` which returns the value for `key` if it exists, otherwise it returns `default`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries support iteration over their keys, values, or key-value pairs and can be used effectively in loops. Functions like `len()` provide the number of key-value pairs in the dictionary. Due to their dynamic and mutable nature, dictionaries are crucial for data storage where quick access and modification are required. They are particularly useful for implementing mappings, databases, caching systems, and so much more."
