"""
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens 
on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack 
each other.

Given an integer n, return the number of distinct 
solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Example 1:
Input: n = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown.

Example 2:
Input: n = 1
Output: 1

Constraints: 1 <= n <= 9
